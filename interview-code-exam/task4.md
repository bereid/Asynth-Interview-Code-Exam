Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is when you like to play with other kids, but you don't want to let them see the details about your toy.

For example, you let your friend, Mike to play with your Legos and built a complete city with them, 
but you don't allow him to know how the buildings built (how many Legos it built from, etc).

In this case, you encapsulate the informations about your Lego-buildings (the number of Legos, the color of them, etc), 
and let Mike to play with the Legos the way you let him.

Abstraction:

Abstraction is when Mike wants to use your Lego to build a city with it, but he doesn't know which 
buildings he have to use to build an operative city.

In this case, you create an abstraction of the city.

It's a non-existing city, it's just a sheet of a paper, where you write down the list of the 
required buildings of an operative city (hospital, police station, school, etc). 

Mike will not be able to built a city if he doesn't build all of the required buildings.

So when Mike wants to build the city, he just grab the sheet of paper and read the requirements.
